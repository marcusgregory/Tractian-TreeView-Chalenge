**Tree View Challenge**

**Description**

Tree View Challenge is a Flutter application designed to visualize and manage hierarchical asset data using a tree view. The app demonstrates effective use of state management, API integration, and user interface design, focusing on performance and usability.

**Features**

-   **Home Page**: Allows users to navigate between different companies and access their assets.
-   **Asset Page**: Displays a dynamic tree structure of assets, components, and locations.
    -   **Visualization**: Presents a hierarchical view of locations, assets, and components.
    -   **Filters**:
        -   **Text Search**: Search for specific items within the asset hierarchy.
        -   **Energy Sensors**: Filter to show only energy sensors.

**Future Improvements**

If more time were available, I would implement Isolates to enhance the performance of the filters. This approach would help to avoid Jank on the screen by offloading heavy filtering tasks to separate threads, ensuring a smoother and more responsive user experience.
